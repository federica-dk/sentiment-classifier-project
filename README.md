# Sentiment classifier project
 
### What it entials:
Classify tweets as positive, neutral, & negative using:
- Cleaned data (lowercase, stopwords removed, lemmatized)
- TF-IDF features
- Baseline Naive Bayes vs SVM (producing a comparison of each model's accuracy)
Production of word clouds with the most common words classified for each of the positive, negative and neutral categories.

  

### Key Findings:
SVM outperforms NB for this dataset. 
Cleaning + lemmatization boost performance.
